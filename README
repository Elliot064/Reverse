I was unclear on whether the no outside functions meant only functions that
would reverse a string for you or no outside functions at all but I was not able
to find a way to do it with no function calls so I used charAt(). To test this code
copy it into gdb online, select java and run it. The file runs at O(n) where n is
the string length, and to avoid using a string length function I included length
as a parameter. This could easily be automated using the strLength() function from
the previous question.

input = "race car" 8
return value = "rac ecar"
input = "banana" 6
return value = "ananab"
